## Information

This repository contains various implementations of a Pacman agent that can play the game and win.

- An agent implementing a Markov Decision Process for playing the game can be found [here](./mdp-agent/).

- An agent using Q-learning to play the game can be found [here](./qlearning_agent/).

Both solutions were implemented as assignments for the university courseworks.
